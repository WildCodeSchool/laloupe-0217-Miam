# MIAM!

Miam! is a website developed with a mobile-first focus, that aims to encourage children to taste new aliments in a playful way.
As such, it is also a tool for parents to diversify the diet of their children.

3. Tell us about you.

-   **Contre indications** is the page where you can tell us about things you can not eat. ATTENTION ! We'll never show you again the aliments you pick there.
-   **Je mange déjà** is the page where you can tell us things you already eat.
Aliments are ordered by categories. If you like the whole category you can click on "tout selectionner". Click on "->" to pass to the next category, "<-" to get back on the previous category.

4. Let's play !

After eating, if you tasted new aliments, ask your parents phone and go on your MIAM!'s profile.
-   On the page "J'ai gouté" click on the aliment you have tasted.
-   On the bottom of the product file you can say if you liked it (green button) or not (red button).

-   If on this list you see an aliment that you want to **taste**, click on it.
-   At the very bottom of the product file click on the button "à gouter".
-   This aliment will be added to your "à gouter" list on the top of the page "J'ai gouté".

4. Check the rewards
On the profile page you can switch to the "recompences" section.

-   Click on the "récompences" button.
-   There you can see chalenges.
-   For each chalenge there is a descrition of what you have to do to finish the challenge.
-   When you finish a chalenge you unlock a reward which is a new option for your avatar (color, hat, etc.).
-   The chalenges already won are colored, the others stay in black and white.
